                        <p>From a young age, I’ve had a deep love for learning. While others may have dreaded early mornings or the end of a school break, I thrived in the classroom. It was my sanctuary—a place where I built confidence and fostered a passion for discovery. Though I wouldn’t claim to be inherently gifted, certain subjects became my obsession. Mathematics, in particular, fascinated me. I often created my own challenging problems after learning a new rule or principle, eager to push my understanding further. This enthusiasm carried through high school, where I achieved top scores of 5 on every AP math exam, including Calculus AB, Calculus BC, and Statistics. The natural progression of my passion led me to envision a lifelong journey with numbers.</p>
                        <p>After serving a two-year mission, I returned with a renewed commitment to both learning and service. Business seemed like the perfect way to merge my love for numbers with my desire to contribute meaningfully to my community. As I delved deeper into my studies, I discovered a particular affinity for accounting—a discipline that perfectly balances precision, problem-solving, and practicality.</p>
                        <p>Beyond academics, I deeply value the connections and relationships we cultivate throughout life. Profound experiences, such as the loss of a close friend and the unwavering support of my family during challenging times, have shaped my perspective. These moments taught me to look outward and find ways to uplift others. Whether through a kind gesture or a listening ear, I’ve come to see service as a cornerstone of a fulfilling life.</p>
                        <p>I also consider myself fortunate to have witnessed both financial hardship and success within my family. These experiences instilled in me a sense of resilience and perspective, reminding me that life’s true worth lies in growth, relationships, and service—not material possessions. The challenges I’ve faced have not only shaped my character but also deepened my empathy for others.</p>
                        <p>Today, I strive to channel my love of learning and passion for service into everything I do, aspiring to make a meaningful difference in both my personal and professional endeavors.</p>
